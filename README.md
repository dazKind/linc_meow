From the [net](https://hub.packtpub.com/molly-rocket-releases-meow-hash-an-extremely-fast-non-cryptographic-hash-for-processing-hundreds-of-game-art-assets/):
> Building game packages demand a faster, non-cryptographic hash for use in change detection and deduplication. Earlier, the Molly Rocket team relied on SHA-1, which was unnecessarily slowing things down. Also, they did not find a well-optimized, large-data hash function to address their game development needs. Currently, most of the hash work seems to focus on small input sizes or on cryptographic quality.
>
> Instead of focusing on the cryptographic quality, this hash function focuses on speed, large datasets, and is collision-free in practice.
